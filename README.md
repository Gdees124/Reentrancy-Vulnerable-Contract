I wrote these contracts as part of a guided course that addressed reentrancy vulnerabilities. This repository includes a reentrancy vulnerable contract and an associated malicious contract that would successfully exploit the vulnerable contract. It also includes two mitigated contracts that use different techniques for reentrancy mitigation. The first one involves reorganizing the lines of code and the second one involves importing Reentrancy Guard. Finally, contract and mitigation testing documentation is also included.
